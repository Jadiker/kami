Goal is to make something that can solve and/or create Kami puzzles. (The iOS game.)

It's clear that the puzzles are topological / color based.

Essentially every stage is a graph of what colors touch what, and you can fill with colors.

I'm not sure if I want the graphs to auto-reduce yet.

Let's build a very simple solver for the time being.

Each puzzle is a graph. Each node has a number and a color.

It's working, but not finding the optimal solution yet.
Need to find out why.
