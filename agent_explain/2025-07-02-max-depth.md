## What I did
- Added optional `max_depth` parameter to `SearchSolver.solve` to stop expanding beyond a specified depth.
- Updated `SolvablePuzzle.solve` to accept the same parameter and pass it through to the solver.
- Improved documentation for the solver and ensured all code passes `pyright`.

## Why I did it
- Limiting search depth allows callers to bound solver runtimes when exploring large puzzles.
- Keeps the generic solver flexible without complicating existing BFS behavior.

## Questions
- None.
